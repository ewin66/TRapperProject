    - WiiYourself! - native C++ Wiimote library  v1.14 BETA
      (c) gl.tter 2007-9 - http://gl.tter.org
________________________________________________________________

This demo app tries to connect to the first Wiimote in the
system, and shows the most important incoming data.

It mainly uses polling (the library is constantly updating
the wiimote state data behind the scenes) but also shows the
callback mechanism by reacting to extension connection changes.
The choice between polling, callbacks, or a mixture of the two
is entirely up to the application.

 - a pre-compiled binary is included.
 - as with the library, the WinDDK is required to build:

Known issues: Extensions connected to a MotionPlus are usually
not detected correctly.  The problem is the
wiimote::DisableMotionPlus() which doesn't work reliably.
Fixes are welcome.
